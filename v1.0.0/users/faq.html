<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.1. </span>What is Syncthing?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-syncthing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>Syncthing</strong>, although the command and source repository is spelled
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">syncthing</span></code> so it may be referred to in that way as well. It’s definitely not
SyncThing, even though the abbreviation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">st</span></code> is used in some

<p>The two are different and not related. Syncthing and BitTorrent/Resilio Sync accomplish
some of the same things, namely syncing files between two or more computers.</p>
<p>BitTorrent Sync, now called Resilio Sync, is a proprietary peer-to-peer file
synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows
Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and BSD. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#resiliosync" id="id2">1</a> Syncthing is an open source file
synchronization tool.</p>
<p>Syncthing uses an open and documented protocol, and likewise the security
mechanisms in use are well defined and visible in the source code. Resilio
Sync uses an undocumented, closed protocol with unknown security properties.</p>

</ul>
<p>The following may be synchronized or not, depending:</p>

<section id="is-synchronization-fast">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.5. </span>Is synchronization fast?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-synchronization-fast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syncthing segments files into pieces, called blocks, to transfer data from one
device to another. Therefore, multiple devices can share the synchronization
load, in a similar way to the torrent protocol. The more devices you have online,
the faster an additional device will receive the data
because small blocks will be fetched from all devices in parallel.</p>
<p>Syncthing handles renaming files and updating their metadata in an efficient
manner. This means that renaming a large file will not cause a retransmission of
that file. Additionally, appending data to existing large files should be
handled efficiently as well.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="syncing.html#temporary-files"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary files</span></a> are used to store partial data
downloaded from other devices. They are automatically removed whenever a file
transfer has been completed or after the configured amount of time which is set
in the configuration file (24 hours by default).</p>

<section id="why-is-the-sync-so-slow">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.6. </span>Why is the sync so slow?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-the-sync-so-slow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When troubleshooting a slow sync, there are a number of things to check.</p>
<p>First of all, verify that you are not connected via a relay. In the “Remote
Devices” list on the right side of the GUI, double check that you see
“Address: &lt;some address&gt;” and <em>not</em> “Relay: &lt;some address&gt;”.</p>
<img alt="../_images/address.png" src="../_images/address.png" />
<p>If you are connected via a relay, this is because a direct connection could
not be established. Double check and follow the suggestions in
<a class="reference internal" href="firewall.html#firewall-setup"><span class="std std-ref">Firewall Setup</span></a> to enable direct connections.</p>
<p>Second, if one of the devices is a very low powered machine (a Raspberry Pi,
or a phone, or a NAS, or similar) you are likely constrained by the CPU on
that device. See the next question for reasons Syncthing likes a faster CPU.
You can verify this by looking at the CPU utilization in the GUI. If it is
constantly at or close to 100%, you are limited by the CPU speed. In some
cases a lower CPU usage number can also indicate being limited by the CPU -
for example constant 25% usage on a four core CPU likely means that
Syncthing is doing something that is not parallellizable and thus limited to
a single CPU core.</p>
<p>Third, verify that the network connection is OK. Tools such as iperf or just
an Internet speed test can be used to verify the performance here.</p>

<section id="why-does-it-use-so-much-cpu">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.7. </span>Why does it use so much CPU?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-it-use-so-much-cpu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When new or changed files are detected, or Syncthing starts for the
first time, your files are hashed using SHA-256.</p></li>
<li><p>Data that is sent over the network is (optionally) compressed and
encrypted using AES-128. When receiving data, it must be decrypted.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a certain amount of housekeeping that must be done to track the
current and available versions of each file in the index database.</p></li>
<li><p>By default Syncthing uses periodic scanning every 60 seconds to detect
file changes. This means checking every file’s modification time and
comparing it to the database. This can cause spikes of CPU usage for large
folders.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hashing, compression and encryption cost CPU time. Also, using the GUI
causes a certain amount of extra CPU usage to calculate the summary data it
presents. Note however that once things are <em>in sync</em> CPU usage should be
negligible.</p>
<p>To minimize the impact of this, Syncthing attempts to <a class="reference internal" href="config.html#set-low-priority"><span class="std std-ref">lower the
process priority</span></a> when starting up.</p>
<p>To further limit the amount of CPU used when syncing and scanning, set the
environment variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GOMAXPROCS</span></code> to the maximum number of CPU cores
Syncthing should use at any given moment. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GOMAXPROCS=2</span></code> on a
machine with four cores will limit Syncthing to no more than half the
system’s CPU power.</p>
<p>To reduce CPU spikes from scanning activity, use a filesystem notifications
plugin. This is delivered by default via Synctrayzor, Syncthing-GTK and on
Android. For other setups, consider using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-inotify">syncthing-inotify</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.8. </span>Should I keep my device IDs secret?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-i-keep-my-device-ids-secret" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No. The IDs are not sensitive. Given a device ID it’s possible to find the IP
address for that device, if global discovery is enabled on it. Knowing the device
ID doesn’t help you actually establish a connection to that device or get a list
of files, etc.</p>
<p>For a connection to be established, both devices need to know about the other’s
device ID. It’s not possible (in practice) to forge a device ID. (To forge a
device ID you need to create a TLS certificate with that specific SHA-256 hash.
If you can do that, you can spoof any TLS certificate. The world is your
oyster!)</p>

<section id="what-if-there-is-a-conflict">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2.9. </span>What if there is a conflict?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-if-there-is-a-conflict" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syncthing does recognize conflicts. When a file has been modified on two devices
simultaneously and the content actually differs, one of the files will be
renamed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;filename&gt;.sync-conflict-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;time&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</span></code>. The file with the
older modification time will be marked as the conflicting file and thus be
renamed. If the modification times are equal, the file originating from the
device which has the larger value of the first 63 bits for his device ID will be
marked as the conflicting file.
If the conflict is between a modification and a deletion of the file, the
modified file always wins and is resurrected without renaming on the
device where it was deleted.</p>
<p>Beware that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;filename&gt;.sync-conflict-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;time&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</span></code> files are
treated as normal files after they are created, so they are propagated between
devices. We do this because the conflict is detected and resolved on one device,
creating the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sync-conflict</span></code> file, but it’s just as much of a conflict
everywhere else and we don’t know which of the conflicting files is the “best”

<p>Syncthing requires a “folder marker” to indicate that the folder is present
and healthy. By default this is a directory called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.stfolder</span></code> that is
created by Syncthing when the folder is added. If this folder can’t be
created (you are serving files from a CD or something) you can instead set
the advanced config <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Marker</span> <span class="pre">Name</span></code> to the name of some file or folder that

<p>Syncthing doesn’t have a direct way to do this, as it’s potentially
dangerous to do so if you’re not careful - it may result in data loss if
something goes wrong during the move and is synchronized to your other
devices.</p>
<p>The easy way to rename or move a synced folder on the local system is to
remove the folder in the Syncthing UI, move it on disk, then re-add it using
the new path.</p>
<p>It’s best to do this when the folder is already in sync between your
devices, as it is otherwise unpredictable which changes will “win” after the
move. Changes made on other devices may be overwritten, or changes made
locally may be overwritten by those on other devices.</p>
<p>An alternative way is to shut down Syncthing, move the folder on disk (including
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.stfolder</span></code> marker), edit the path directly in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config.xml</span></code> in the
configuration folder (see <a class="reference internal" href="config.html#config"><span class="std std-ref">Syncthing Configuration</span></a>) and then start Syncthing again.</p>

<p>Syncthing does not specially handle this case, and most files most likely get
re-downloaded.</p>
<p>In detail, the behavior depends on the scan order. If you have folder A and B,
and move files from A to B, if A gets scanned first, it will announce removal of
the files to others who will remove the files. As you rescan B, B will
announce addition of new files, and other peers will have nowhere to get
them from apart from re-downloading them.</p>
<p>If B gets rescanned first, B will announce additions first, remote
peers will reconstruct the files (not rename, more like copy block by
block) from A, and then as A gets rescanned remove the files from A.</p>
<p>A workaround would be to copy first from A to B, rescan B, wait for B to
rebuild on remote ends, and then delete from A.</p>

<p>The patterns in .stignore are glob patterns, where brackets are used to

<p>To match an actual file <em>called</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q[abc]x</span></code> the pattern needs to “escape”
the brackets, like so: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q\[abc\]x</span></code>.</p>
<p>On Windows, escaping special characters is not supported as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code>

<p>Security over convenience. In Syncthing you have to setup both sides to
connect two devices. An attacker can’t do much with a stolen device ID, because
you have to add the device on the other side too. You have better control

<p>The default listening address is 127.0.0.1:8384, so you can only access the
GUI from the same machine. This is for security reasons. Change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GUI</span>
<span class="pre">listen</span> <span class="pre">address</span></code> through the web UI from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1:8384</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.0.0.0:8384</span></code> or change the config.xml:</p>
<div class="highlight-xml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;gui</span> <span class="na">enabled=</span><span class="s">&quot;true&quot;</span> <span class="na">tls=</span><span class="s">&quot;false&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;address&gt;</span>0.0.0.0:8384<span class="nt">&lt;/address&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then the GUI is accessible from everywhere. You should set a password and
enable HTTPS with this configuration. You can do this from inside the GUI.</p>
<p>If both your computers are Unix-like (Linux, Mac, etc.) you can also leave the
GUI settings at default and use an ssh port forward to access it. For
example,</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ssh -L <span class="m">9090</span>:127.0.0.1:8384 user@othercomputer.example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will log you into othercomputer.example.com, and present the <em>remote</em>
Syncthing GUI on <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:9090">http://localhost:9090</a> on your <em>local</em> computer.</p>
<p>If you only want to access the remote gui and don’t want the terminal
session, use this example,</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ssh -N -L <span class="m">9090</span>:127.0.0.1:8384 user@othercomputer.example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If only your remote computer is Unix-like,
you can still access it with ssh from Windows.</p>
<p>Under Windows 10 (64 bit) you can use the same ssh command if you install
the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

<p>Since version 0.14.6 Syncthing does an extra security check when the GUI/API
is bound to localhost - namely that the browser is talking to localhost.
This protects against most forms of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding">DNS rebinding attack</a> against the GUI.</p>
<p>To pass this test, ensure that you are accessing the GUI using an URL that
begins with <cite>http://localhost</cite>, <cite>http://127.0.0.1</cite> or <cite>http://[::1]</cite>. HTTPS
is fine too, of course.</p>
<p>If you are using a proxy in front of Syncthing you may need to disable this
check, after ensuring that the proxy provides sufficient authentication to
protect against unauthorized access. Either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure the proxy sets a <cite>Host</cite> header containing <cite>localhost</cite>, or</p></li>
<li><p>Set <cite>insecureSkipHostcheck</cite> in the advanced settings, or</p></li>
<li><p>Bind the GUI/API to a non-localhost listen port.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, username/password authentication and HTTPS should be used.</p>

<p>You can change the theme in the settings. Syncthing ships with other themes
than the default.</p>
<p>If you want a custom theme or a completely different GUI, you can add your
own.
By default, Syncthing will look for a directory <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gui</span></code> inside the Syncthing
home folder. To change the directory to look for themes, you need to set the
STGUIASSETS environment variable. To get the concrete directory, run
syncthing with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-paths</span></code> parameter. It will print all the relevant paths,
including the “GUI override directory”.</p>
<p>To add e.g. a red theme, you can create the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">red/assets/css/theme.css</span></code>
inside the GUI override directory to override the default CSS styles.</p>
<p>To create a whole new GUI, you should checkout the files at

<p>The audit log (and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Global</span> <span class="pre">Changes</span></code> window) sees the changes that your
Syncthing sees. When Syncthing is continuously connected it usually sees every change
happening immediately and thus knows which node initiated the change.
When topology gets complex or when your node reconnects after some time offline,
Syncthing synchronises with its neighbours: It gets the latest synchronised state
from the neighbour, which is the <em>result</em> of all the changes between the last
known state (before disconnect or network delay) and the current state at the
neighbour, and if there were updates, deletes, creates, conflicts, which were
overlapping we only see the <em>latest change</em> for a given file or directory (and
the node where that latest change occurred). When we connect to multiple neighbours
Syncthing decides which neighbor has the latest state, or if the states conflict
it initiates the conflict resolution procedure, which in the end results in a consistent
up-to-date state with all the neighbours.</p>
