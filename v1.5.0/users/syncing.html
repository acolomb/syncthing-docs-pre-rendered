<span id="syncing"></span><h1>Understanding Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-synchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This article describes the mechanisms Syncthing uses to bring files in sync
on a high level.</p>
<div class="section" id="blocks">
<h2>Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#blocks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Files are divided into <em>blocks</em>. The blocks making up a file are all the
same size (except the last one in the file which may be smaller). The block
size is dependent on the file size and varies from 128 KiB up to 16 MiB.
Each file is sliced into a number of these blocks, and the SHA256 hash of
each block is computed. This results in a <em>block list</em> containing the
offset, size and hash of all blocks in the file.</p>
<p>To update a file, Syncthing compares the block list of the current version
of the file to the block list of the desired version of the file. It then
tries to find a source for each block that differs. This might be locally,
if another file already has a block with the same hash, or it may be from
another device in the cluster. In the first case the block is simply copied
on disk, in the second case it is requested over the network from the other
device.</p>
<p>When a block is copied or received from another device, its SHA256 hash is
computed and compared with the expected value. If it matches the block is
written to a temporary copy of the file, otherwise it is discarded and
Syncthing tries to find another source for the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scanning">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Scanning<a class="headerlink" href="#scanning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two methods how Syncthing detects changes: By regular full scans and
by notifications received from the filesystem (“watcher”). By default the
watcher is enabled and full scans are done once per hour. This behaviour can be
changed by folder. Increasing the full scan interval uses less resources and is
useful for example on large folders that change infrequently. To make sure that
not all folders are rescanned at the same time, the actual scan interval is a
random time between 3/4 and 5/4 of the given scan interval. Even with watcher
enabled it is advised to keep regular full scans enabled, as it is possible that
some changes aren’t picked up by it.</p>
<p>During a rescan (regardless whether full or from watcher) the existing files are
checked for changes to their modification time, size or permission bits. The
file is “rehashed” if a change is detected based on those attributes, that is a
new block list is calculated for the file. It is not possible to know which
parts of a file have changed without reading the file and computing new SHA256
hashes for each block.</p>
<p>The watcher does not immediately schedule a scan when a change is detected. It
accumulates changes for 10s (adjustable by <a class="reference internal" href="config.html#fswatcherdelays"><span class="std std-ref">fsWatcherDelayS</span></a>) and deleted files
are further delayed for 1min. Therefore it is expected that you experience a
slight delay between making the change and it appearing on another device.</p>
<p>Changes that were detected and hashed are transmitted to the other devices
after each rescan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Syncing<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syncthing keeps track of several versions of each file - the version that it
currently has on disk, called the <em>local</em> version, the versions announced by
all other connected devices, and the “best” (usually the most recent)
version of the file. This version is called the <em>global</em> version and is the
one that each device strives to be up to date with.</p>
<p>This information is kept in the <em>index database</em>, which is stored in the
configuration directory and called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">index-vx.y.z.db</span></code> (for some version
x.y.z which may not be exactly the version of Syncthing you’re running).</p>
<p>When new index data is received from other devices Syncthing recalculates
which version for each file should be the global version, and compares this
to the current local version. When the two differ, Syncthing needs to
synchronize the file. The block lists are compared to build a list of needed
blocks, which are then requested from the network or copied locally, as
described above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="temporary-files">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Temporary Files<a class="headerlink" href="#temporary-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syncthing never writes directly to a destination file. Instead all changes
are made to a temporary copy which is then moved in place over the old
version. If an error occurs during the copying or syncing, such as a
necessary block not being available, the temporary file is kept around for
up to a day. This is to avoid needlessly requesting data over the network.</p>
<p>The temporary files are named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.syncthing.original-filename.ext.tmp</span></code> or,
on Windows, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~syncthing~original-filename.ext.tmp</span></code> where
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">original-filename.ext</span></code> is the destination filename. The temporary file is
normally hidden. If the temporary file name would be too long due to the
addition of the prefix and extra extension, a hash of the original file name
is used instead of the actual original file name.</p>
